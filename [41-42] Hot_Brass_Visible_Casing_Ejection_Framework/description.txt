[h1] Hot Brass - Visible Casing Ejection Framework [/h1]
For a long time, I wondered how cool Project Zomboid would look if we could actually see spent casings flying out of our weapons. That curiosity eventually turned into a desire to learn how to mod and now here we are.

This is both a mod and a framework that other weapon mods can use to add visible casing ejection

[h2] Changes to Gameplay [/h2]

Racking has been reworked so that when you rack a round, it won t magically appear in your pocket anymore it will realistically fall to the ground. Don t forget to pick them up!

Unloading is now more practical and prevents you from accidentally dropping ammo all over the floor.

Spent casings can be collected, and in a future update they ll be used for ammo crafting.

[h2] Mod is still a Work in Progress! [/h2]

[h2]VERSION 41 MULTIPLAYER FIXED[/h2]
[B]But keep in mind, the mod is best designed for singleplayer. I am not a networking expert but I manage to solve an issue with multiple duplications of the casings in MP, while sacrificing "frames" of the casing flying[/b]

To Do:
[list]
[*]Keep covering popular mods, check the repo addon for them.
[*]Improve MP performance.
[/list]

[b] If you find a bug please report it in the thread for it, not the comments [/b]

[h3] Huge Thanks! [/h3]

Thank you to everyone in the PZ Modding Discord for the support on my first mod.
Special thanks to Vilespring and Sven for allowing me to use VFE ammo icons.

[h2] For Modders [/h2]

I ve included an easy-to-use function that lets you register your weapons with this system.
You can safely overwrite the existing table it's designed to handle custom parameters without issues.

[b]Key parameters to know: [/b]

[list]
[*]Forward, side, and height offsets let you calibrate exactly where the casing appears relative to the player.
[*]Shell force determines how far the casing is ejected. Negative values will launch it in the opposite direction useful if you want something unusual.
[*]Manual ejection controls whether a weapon requires racking to cycle the ammo.
[/list]

[b]Currently the mod also supports B41. but I have not test it extensively. so if you encounter a bug report it.[/b]
