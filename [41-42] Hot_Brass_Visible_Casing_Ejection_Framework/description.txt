[h1] Hot Brass - Visible Casing Ejection Framework [/h1]
I personally love small details, and even on games with graphic styles that are meant to be retro, having those little details make it so cool. For a long time, I wondered how cool Project Zomboid would look if we could actually see spent casings flying out of our weapons. kinda inspired like the classic Resident Evil games. From that curiosity I dive into the PZ modding discord (amazing place btw).

This is both a mod and a framework that other weapon mods can use to add visible casing ejection.

[h2] Changes to Gameplay [/h2]

Racking has been reworked so that when you rack a round, it won’t magically appear in your pocket anymore; it will realistically fall to the ground. Don’t forget to pick them up!

Unloading is now more practical and prevents you from accidentally dropping ammo all over the floor.

Spent casings can be collected, and in a future update they’ll be used for ammo crafting.

[h2] Mod is still a Work in Progress! [/h2]

Some of the things casings will do
[list]
[*] React to the world around, fall to different levels, react against walls, land on objects (tables, chairs, counters, etc...), open or close windows or doors
[*] Bounce around
[*] Play appropiate casing sounds to the tile they are landing open
[*] be cool looking :D
[/list]

[h2]VERSION 41 MULTIPLAYER FIXED[/h2]
[b]Mod is better experience in SP due to the way I had to achieve the visual effect.[/b] MP in 41 is supported, but I have not tested the extend to which it will impact performance on large servers.

To Do:
[list]
[*]Keep covering popular mods; check the repo addon for them.
[*]Improve MP performance.
[*]Ammo crafting. It will come, I promise.
[/list]

[b]If you find a bug, please report it in the thread for it, not the comments.[/b]

[h3] Huge Thanks! [/h3]

Thank you to everyone in the PZ Modding Discord for the support on my first mod.
Special thanks to Vilespring and Sven for allowing me to use VFE ammo icons.

[h2] For Modders [/h2]

I have redone the structure of the mod, so if you wish to implement it or want to change the functionality of a function, you can patch it by calling the main object and the desired function.
I have left a commented-out file that gives you an example of how you can easily register your params table with the mod.

I am working on making it so that if a gun is not registered, it will pick some random params based on the model, but only if this uses ammo or casings I have within the mod. Custom ammo will require registering.

[b]Key parameters to know: [/b]

[list]
[*]Forward, side, and height offsets let you calibrate exactly where the casing appears relative to the player.
[*]Shell force determines how far the casing is ejected. Negative values will launch it in the opposite direction, useful if you want something unusual.
[*]Manual ejection controls whether a weapon requires racking to cycle the ammo.
[*]verticalForce can apply more force to the shell or send it downwards, for those weapons where the spent casings go straight to the floor (MG42 comes to mind).
[*]ejectionAngle lets you determine if the casing comes forward, left, right, or back, full control to make it authentic.
[/list]

[b]Currently the mod also supports B41, but I have not tested it extensively, so if you encounter a bug, report it.[/b]

Currently covered Mods:
[list]
[*] Firearms B41 and B42
[*] VFE 41 and Unofficial 42
[*] Filibuster Rhymes's Acceptable Guns
[*] Rain's Firearms & Gun Parts [B42]
[*] WIP Guns of 93
[/list]

I will not be covering Brita’s Gun anytime soon. While that mod already has casing ejection, 300+ guns, and tons of custom ammo, it fundamentally changes some of the functions I modify to achieve the racking and reloading effects.
