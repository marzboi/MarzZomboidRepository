[h1][b]NEW MAJOR VERSION 1.1[/b][/h1]

[h1][b]I have reworked a lot of the mod's internals, and it now has compatibility with popular mods in version 41 and 42.13 onward.[/b][/h1]
[b]Version 42.12 has been faced out and its now hosted in where the repos are, since we no longer need patches. the ModID for version 42 will change in the near future back to the original ID[/b]

[b]Works in MP for 41 and 42, casings are tight to server tick rate hence why the slow FPS of casings.[/b]

[h2] Hot Brass - Visible Casing Ejection Framework [/h2]

Is a passion project and my first official mod. I always love keeping an eye on small details, and that's why I started on a journey of making casings visible and now it has evolved into something more than I originally envisioned.

BIG thanks to the modding community from Zomboid and all the wonderful people in there.

[h2] Changes to Gameplay [/h2]

Racking now causes you to eject an unfired round, make sure you pick them up. Revolvers and manually-loaded shotguns behave the same as in vanilla for racking.

[h3] Special recognition [/h3]

Thank you to everyone in the PZ Modding Discord and Special thanks to Vilespring for allowing me to use VFE ammo icons and Sven for the constant support and bughunting for version 41!

[h2] For Modders [/h2]

I have redone the structure of the mod, so if you wish to implement it or want to change the functionality of a function, you can patch it by calling the main object and the desired function.
Look over at some of the integrated params table for examples on custom fly patterns for casings.

[h3] For Modders [/h3]
If you are looking for version 42.12, I will be posting in a workshop item.

If you wish to support my work!
