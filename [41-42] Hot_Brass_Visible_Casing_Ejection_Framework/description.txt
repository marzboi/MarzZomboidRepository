[h1]Update for 42.13.1[/h1]
[h1][b]NEW MAJOR VERSION HAS BUILT IN COMPATIBILITY WITH MODS EVEN WITHOUT PATCHES[/b][/h1]

[b]Works in MP for 41 and 42, casings are tight to server tick rate hence why the slow FPS of casings.[/b]

[h1]Legacy version for 42.12 is left for those not migrating to 42.13, no new features will be added to this version[/h1]

[h1] Hot Brass - Visible Casing Ejection Framework [/h1]
I personally love small details, and even on games with graphic styles that are meant to be retro, having those little details make it so cool. For a long time, I wondered how cool Project Zomboid would look if we could actually see spent casings flying out of our weapons. kinda inspired like the classic Resident Evil games. From that curiosity I dive into the PZ modding discord (amazing place btw).

This is both a mod and a framework that other weapon mods can use to add visible casing ejection.

[h2] Changes to Gameplay [/h2]

Racking has been reworked so that when you rack a round, it won’t magically appear in your pocket anymore; it will realistically fall to the ground. Don’t forget to pick them up!

Unloading is now more practical and prevents you from accidentally dropping ammo all over the floor.

Spent casings can be collected, and in a future update they’ll be used for ammo crafting.

[h2] Native support for Guns of 93 [42] and other mods. Tables are now optional if you want more customized casing fly patterns.[/h2]

[h2] Mod is still a Work in Progress! [/h2]

Some of the things casings will do
[list]
[*] React to the world around, fall to different levels, react against walls, land on objects (tables, chairs, counters, etc...), open or close windows or doors
[*] Bounce around
[*] Play appropiate casing sounds to the tile they are landing open
[*] be cool looking :D
[/list]

To Do:
[list]
[*]Ammo crafting. It will come, I promise.
[/list]

[b]If you find a bug, please report it in the thread for it, not the comments.[/b]

[h3] Huge Thanks! [/h3]

Thank you to everyone in the PZ Modding Discord for the support on my first mod.
Special thanks to Vilespring and Sven for allowing me to use VFE ammo icons.

[h2] For Modders [/h2]

I have redone the structure of the mod, so if you wish to implement it or want to change the functionality of a function, you can patch it by calling the main object and the desired function.
I have left a commented-out file that gives you an example of how you can easily register your params table with the mod.

I am working on making it so that if a gun is not registered, it will pick some random params based on the model, but only if this uses ammo or casings I have within the mod. Custom ammo will require registering.

patches will be deprecated in upcoming versions, will stay up for those playing in legacy 42 version.
