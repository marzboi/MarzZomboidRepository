description=[h1] Hot Brass – Visible Casing Ejection Framework [/h1]
description=
description=For a long time, I wondered how cool Project Zomboid would look if we could actually see spent casings flying out of our weapons. That curiosity eventually turned into a desire to learn how to mod and now here we are.
description=
description=This is both a mod and a framework that other weapon mods can use to add visible casing ejection
description=
description=[h2] Changes to Gameplay [/h2]
description=
description=Racking has been reworked so that when you rack a round, it won’t magically appear in your pocket anymore it will realistically fall to the ground. Don’t forget to pick them up!
description=
description=Unloading is now more practical and prevents you from accidentally dropping ammo all over the floor.
description=
description=Spent casings can be collected, and in a future update they’ll be used for ammo crafting.
description=
description=[h2] Mod is still a Work in Progress! [/h2]
description=
description=To Do:
description=[list]
description=[*][strike]Move the sound of casings hitting the floor to the casings themselves. Unfortunately this is handled on Zomboid’s Java side, so for now the sound will behave the traditional way. [/strike]
description=[*]Add randomized bounces when casings hit the ground for extra visual flair.
description=[*]As per request, I will be adding support to popular mods.
description=[/list]
description=
description=[b] If you find a bug please report it in the thread for it, not the comments [/b]
description=
description=[h3] Huge Thanks! [/h3]
description=
description=Thank you to everyone in the PZ Modding Discord for the support on my first mod.
description=Special thanks to Vilespring and Sven for allowing me to use VFE ammo icons.
description=
description=[h2] For Modders [/h2]
description=
description=I’ve included an easy-to-use function that lets you register your weapons with this system.
description=You can safely overwrite the existing table it's designed to handle custom parameters without issues.
description=
description=[b]Key parameters to know: [/b]
description=
description=[list]
description=[*]Forward, side, and height offsets let you calibrate exactly where the casing appears relative to the player.
description=[*]Shell force determines how far the casing is ejected. Negative values will launch it in the opposite direction useful if you want something unusual.
description=[*]Manual ejection controls whether a weapon requires racking to cycle the ammo.
description=[/list]
description=
description=[b]Currently the mod also supports B41. but I have not test it extensively. so if you encounter a bug report it.[/b]
