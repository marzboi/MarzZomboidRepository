title=[41/42] Hot Brass - Visible Casing Ejection Framework
description=[h1] Hot Brass - Visible Casing Ejection Framework [/h1]
description=I personally love small details, and even on games with graphic styles that are meant to be retro, having those little details make it so cool. For a long time, I wondered how cool Project Zomboid would look if we could actually see spent casings flying out of our weapons. kinda inspired like the classic Resident Evil games. From that curiosity I dive into the PZ modding discord (amazing place btw).
description=
description=This is both a mod and a framework that other weapon mods can use to add visible casing ejection.
description=
description=[h2] Changes to Gameplay [/h2]
description=
description=Racking has been reworked so that when you rack a round, it won’t magically appear in your pocket anymore; it will realistically fall to the ground. Don’t forget to pick them up!
description=
description=Unloading is now more practical and prevents you from accidentally dropping ammo all over the floor.
description=
description=Spent casings can be collected, and in a future update they’ll be used for ammo crafting.
description=
description=[h2] Mod is still a Work in Progress! [/h2]
description=
description=Some of the things casings will do
description=[list]
description=[*] React to the world around, fall to different levels, react against walls, land on objects (tables, chairs, counters, etc...), open or close windows or doors
description=[*] Bounce around
description=[*] Play appropiate casing sounds to the tile they are landing open
description=[*] be cool looking :D
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h2]VERSION 41 MULTIPLAYER FIXED[/h2]
description=[b]Mod is better experience in SP due to the way I had to achieve the visual effect.[/b] MP in 41 is supported, but I have not tested the extend to which it will impact performance on large servers.
description=
description=To Do:
description=[list]
description=[*]Keep covering popular mods; check the repo addon for them.
description=[*]Improve MP performance.
description=[*]Ammo crafting. It will come, I promise.
description=[/list]
description=
description=[b]If you find a bug, please report it in the thread for it, not the comments.[/b]
description=
description=[h3] Huge Thanks! [/h3]
description=
description=Thank you to everyone in the PZ Modding Discord for the support on my first mod.
description=Special thanks to Vilespring and Sven for allowing me to use VFE ammo icons.
description=
description=[h2] For Modders [/h2]
description=
description=I have redone the structure of the mod, so if you wish to implement it or want to change the functionality of a function, you can patch it by calling the main object and the desired function.
description=I have left a commented-out file that gives you an example of how you can easily register your params table with the mod.
description=
description=I am working on making it so that if a gun is not registered, it will pick some random params based on the model, but only if this uses ammo or casings I have within the mod. Custom ammo will require registering.
description=
description=[b]Key parameters to know: [/b]
description=
description=[list]
description=[*]Forward, side, and height offsets let you calibrate exactly where the casing appears relative to the player.
description=[*]Shell force determines how far the casing is ejected. Negative values will launch it in the opposite direction, useful if you want something unusual.
description=[*]Manual ejection controls whether a weapon requires racking to cycle the ammo.
description=[*]verticalForce can apply more force to the shell or send it downwards, for those weapons where the spent casings go straight to the floor (MG42 comes to mind).
description=[*]ejectionAngle lets you determine if the casing comes forward, left, right, or back, full control to make it authentic.
description=[/list]
description=
description=[b]Currently the mod also supports B41, but I have not tested it extensively, so if you encounter a bug, report it.[/b]

description=Currently covered Mods:
description=[list]
description=[*] Firearms B41 and B42
description=[*] VFE 41 and Unofficial 42
description=[*] Filibuster Rhymes's Acceptable Guns
description=[*] Rain's Firearms & Gun Parts [B42]
description=[*] WIP Guns of 93
description=[/list]
description=
description=I will not be covering Brita’s Gun anytime soon. While that mod already has casing ejection, 300+ guns, and tons of custom ammo, it fundamentally changes some of the functions I modify to achieve the racking and reloading effects.
