[h1]RAF - Real Automatic Firerate[/h1]

[b]This mod simulates automatic firerate as close as Zomboid permits to real-life weapons' Rounds Per Minute.[/b]

[h2][b]New Burst fire mode is out! I have patched the Assault Rifle to use the new mode.[/b][/h2]

As I kept experimenting and learning with the game, I was surprised to see automatic fire being kind of slow, plus it was affected by the game's refresh rate if it was high enough. I also realized that many of the current approaches in the Workshop required an animset with not much room for customization.

Having made Hot Brass and enjoying putting this little attention to detail into the game, I got distracted while finishing the Ammo Crafting module for Hot Brass and came up with this.

[b]I present to you RAF![/b]

What does the mod do?

I use a script in the Attack Hook event of the game, and with a timer and some functions, I limit the automatic fire based on the RPM of that weapon.

As a modder, do you want to implement this?

All you have to do is add a tag to your weapon script with the desired RPM.

Right now, RPMs covered by the mod range from 300 to 1200 with 50-step increases each, which I feel is plenty enough to play around with.

If you also want to use the Burst mode from the mod, all you have to do is enable Burst as a fire mode for your weapon. Optionally, you can add a tag to specify how many bullets to shoot in each burst volley. Currently covered: 2 to 4 rounds.

I can add more RPM options or rounds per burst if modders request it—just DM me on Discord if you want to chat.

This mod is now a hard dependency for my port of VFE.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making this! :D

[h3]Incompatibilities[/h3]

- Mod is still a WIP, so report any bugs with a proper description.
- I still need to find a way to support 24 and 30 refresh rates.
- I will assume that there are none. I monkey-patch the Attack Hook, so if a mod has custom logic for it, no issues should arise from using this. If a weapon has no tags, it will default to 600 RPM.
