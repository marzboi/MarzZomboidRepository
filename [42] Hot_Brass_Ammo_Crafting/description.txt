[h2]Now you'll want to pick up those casings![/h2]

Welcome to Ammo Crafting for Hot Brass. There's not much to explain here.

Casings now have recipes that let you craft ammo again. You will find a reloading tool in different places.

Ammo crafting is a rather simple process: find a box of primers, gunpowder, and the projectile type for the round you want to craft.

Currently, it supports vanilla and VFE ammo types. More in the future.

This is still a work in progress. I'm slowly trying to get distribution right, and I may add boxes of empty casings so you can craft bullets from scratch.

Any feedback is appreciated!
