[h1]Unofficial Port of VFE and Addons[/h1]

[h2]VFE Stalker Edition Out now![/h2]
Ported version of Stalker included in the back.

With approval from Vilespring, and after months of work, I have ported VFE, one of the greatest addons in the community, to Build 42 (Unofficially).

This version serves as a temporary port while Vilespring works on officially updating VFE for Build 42, taking full advantage of all the new systems with skills far beyond mine.

Consider this a tribute to the great VFE and its Devs while official development continues.

[h2]About This Port[/h2]

I have taken the time to faithfully port all the core functionalities from the original Build 41 version, while also incorporating some of the new systems introduced in Build 42.

[b]Still a work in progress:[/b]
• Professions included in the original mod

[h2]Additional Integration[/h2]

Support for my mod Hot Brass has been added if you wish to see visible shell casings ejecting from firearms. [b]While is marked as required, its not.[/b]

[h2]Development Intent[/h2]

I will continue refining what I can, focusing on accuracy to Build 41 rather than adding new features.
If you encounter any bugs, please report them in a proper discussion thread, not in the comments.
And please, do not contact Vilespring regarding issues with this unofficial port.

[h2]List of Changes[/h2]
- Couple magazines can be attach along slings due to 42 allowing further attachments.
- I will add silencers at some point, after work with VFES and VFE93 is done.
- Addons will be integrated into one subscription.
- Optional usage of my visual casing mod.
- B42 bullet cartons are part of the options for packing ammo boxes.

I’m continuing to learn the inner workings of this game to give back to the creators who gave us such great experiences with their work.

[h2]Availability[/h2]

This mod will remain available until the official VFE update is released. Once that happens, it will be set to Unlisted.

[b]Enjoy![/b]
