[h1]Update for 42.13[/h1]
[b]I have marked version 42.13 as B42. A patch for Hot Brass is inclded as well. the issue with opening boxes of ammo is not cause by this mod.[/b]

[h1]Legacy version for 42.12 is left for those not migrating to 42.13, no new features will be added to this version[/h1]

[h1]VFE Post 93 weapons Out![/h1]
Ported VFE93 weapons and added some new features missing from it. ammos will have packs, cases and crates. SD variants are more rare than nonSD, but suppressors have made it into the game. if you find one for the gun. this one can be attach or remove like a Bayonet.

[h2]VFE Stalker Edition Out now![/h2]
Ported version of Stalker included in the back.

With approval from Vilespring, and after months of work, I have ported VFE, one of the greatest addons in the community, to Build 42 (Unofficially).

This version serves as a temporary port while Vilespring works on officially updating VFE for Build 42, taking full advantage of all the new systems with skills far beyond mine.

Consider this a tribute to the great VFE and its Devs while official development continues.

[h2]About This Port[/h2]

I have taken the time to faithfully port all the core functionalities from the original Build 41 version, while also incorporating some of the new systems introduced in Build 42.

[b]Changes[/b]
[b]VFE[/b]
[list]
[*] JungleMags (Couple Mags) can be equipt with slings, due to new attachment categories introduce in B42.
[*] Ammo Cartons are introduced along with Packs, Cases and Crates as a cheaper alternative.
[/list]

[b]VFES[/b]
[list]
[*] New Caliber types for Rifles and the VSS, 7.62x54mm and 9x39mm can be found along the already existing 5.45mm
[*] Introduce same ammo packing logic to all new VFES calibers. they can now be condense into packs, cases, crates or cartons
[/list]

[b]VFE94[/b]
[list]
[*] Added Suppressors as an item that can be found. allowing you to alternate between the SD and NON SD variant of certain guns.
[*] Allowed ammo packing of new ammunitions as well.
[/list]

[h2]Additional Integration[/h2]

Both RAF and Hot Brass are marked as dependencies [b]BUT THEY ARE NOT[/b]. they are both optional to enhance the experience in the game.

[h2]Development Intent[/h2]

I will continue refining what I can, focusing on accuracy to Build 41 rather than adding new features.
If you encounter any bugs, please report them in a proper discussion thread, not in the comments.
And please, do not contact Vilespring regarding issues with this unofficial port.

I’m continuing to learn the inner workings of this game to give back to the creators who gave us such great experiences with their work.

[h2]Availability[/h2]

This mod will remain available until the official VFE update is released. Once that happens, it will be set to Unlisted.

[b]Enjoy![/b]
